### The impact of socio-economic factors on gambling behaviour in England : this study focuses on the socio-economic factors that impact gambling behaviour, with the aim of shedding light on the underlying reasons why people gamble.

The societal and economic impacts of gambling are well documented and have been the focus of many studies not excluded
to the Public Health England and Gambling Commission studies. Rather than focusing on the factors caused by gambling
behaviour, this study will focus on the socio-economic factors that impact gambling behaviour, with the aim of shedding
light on the underlying reasons why people gamble. The aim of the model is to predict gambling activity (i.e. whether
someone is likely to participate in gambling activity or not) based on socio-economic factors. This research is essential in
understanding the dynamics of gambling and the formation of gambling habits, which can help elicit some understanding
and help provide support to at-risk groups. Furthermore, by using a data science approach, it allows an opportunity to extract
valuable insights from vast amounts of data and apply machine learning techniques. The insights that are drawn from these
methods can help develop effective interventions and policies to address the causes of gambling and problem gambling.
